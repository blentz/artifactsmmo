Tests for Unified Sub-Goal Architecture Validation

This module validates that the unified sub-goal architecture meets the PRP requirements:
1. No converters needed - SubGoalRequest becomes Goal instances directly
2. Same facilities - Sub-goals use identical interfaces as regular goals  
3. Limited scope - Only ActionExecutor and GoalManager understand "sub-goals"
4. Transparent integration - Rest of system only sees Goal objects, never SubGoalRequest
