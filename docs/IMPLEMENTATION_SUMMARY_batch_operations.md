# Batch Operations Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented batch operations functionality for the artifactsmmo CLI, allowing users to repeat actions multiple times with comprehensive cooldown handling, progress tracking, and result accumulation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Batch Command
- **Command**: `artifactsmmo action batch <character> <action> --times <n> [options]`
- **Supported Actions**: gather, fight, rest
- **Options**:
  - `--times, -t`: Number of times to repeat the action (required)
  - `--wait-cooldown, -w`: Wait for cooldowns between actions (optional)
  - `--continue-on-error, -c`: Continue on error instead of stopping (optional)

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress bar using Rich Progress
- Shows current iteration (e.g., "Executing action 3/10")
- Displays elapsed time
- Shows cooldown countdown when waiting

### 3. Result Accumulation
- Tracks total XP gained across all actions
- Tracks total gold gained
- Accumulates items collected with quantities
- Counts successful vs failed actions
- Calculates success rate and average time per action

### 4. Cooldown Handling
- Detects cooldowns from API responses
- Optional waiting with `--wait-cooldown` flag
- Shows countdown timer during cooldown waits
- Retries action after cooldown expires

### 5. Error Handling
- Stops on first error by default
- Optional continue-on-error mode with `--continue-on-error` flag
- Graceful interrupt handling (Ctrl+C)
- Comprehensive error reporting

### 6. Result Summary
- Displays detailed summary table at completion
- Shows total attempts, successes, failures
- Displays accumulated XP, gold, and items
- Shows total time and average time per action

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. BatchResults Class
```python
@dataclass
class BatchResults:
    total_attempts: int = 0
    successful_actions: int = 0
    failed_actions: int = 0
    total_xp: int = 0
    total_gold: int = 0
    items_collected: dict[str, int] = field(default_factory=lambda: defaultdict(int))
    start_time: float = field(default_factory=time.time)
    errors: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
```

#### 2. Action Executors
- `execute_gather_action(character: str) -> CLIResponse[Any]`
- `execute_fight_action(character: str) -> CLIResponse[Any]`
- `execute_rest_action(character: str) -> CLIResponse[Any]`

#### 3. Action Mapping
```python
ACTION_EXECUTORS: dict[str, Callable[[str], CLIResponse[Any]]] = {
    "gather": execute_gather_action,
    "fight": execute_fight_action,
    "rest": execute_rest_action,
}
```

#### 4. Interrupt Handling
- Global `_interrupted` flag
- Signal handler for SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
- Graceful termination with partial results

### Key Features

#### Progress Display
- Uses Rich Progress with spinner, text, and elapsed time
- Updates description for current action and cooldown status
- Non-transient display for better user experience

#### Result Extraction
- Intelligently extracts XP, gold, and items from different response formats
- Handles fight results (XP, gold, drops)
- Handles gathering results (XP, items)
- Supports various API response structures

#### Cooldown Management
- Detects cooldown from CLIResponse.cooldown_remaining
- Optional waiting with countdown display
- Automatic retry after cooldown expires
- Configurable behavior (wait vs stop)

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **12 Batch Command Tests**: Cover all major functionality
- **4 Action Executor Tests**: Test individual action functions
- **4 BatchResults Tests**: Test result accumulation logic

### Test Coverage
- Success scenarios for all action types
- Cooldown handling (with and without waiting)
- Error handling (continue vs stop on error)
- Result accumulation and summary formatting
- Interrupt handling
- Input validation

### Test Examples
```python
def test_batch_gather_success(self, runner, mock_client_manager):
    """Test successful batch gather command."""
    # Mock API and test 3 gather actions

def test_batch_with_cooldown_and_wait(self, runner, mock_client_manager):
    """Test batch command with cooldown and wait flag."""
    # Test cooldown detection and waiting behavior

def test_batch_results_accumulation(self, runner, mock_client_manager):
    """Test that batch results are properly accumulated."""
    # Test XP, gold, and item accumulation across multiple actions
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Gather 5 times, stop on cooldown
artifactsmmo action batch mychar gather --times 5

# Fight 10 times, wait for cooldowns
artifactsmmo action batch mychar fight --times 10 --wait-cooldown

# Rest 3 times, continue on errors
artifactsmmo action batch mychar rest --times 3 --continue-on-error
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Comprehensive gathering session
artifactsmmo action batch mychar gather --times 20 --wait-cooldown --continue-on-error
```
