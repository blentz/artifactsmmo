# Pathfinding and Auto-Navigation Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented pathfinding and auto-navigation commands for the ArtifactsMMO CLI to make movement more efficient.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Core Pathfinding System
- **Location**: `src/artifactsmmo_cli/utils/pathfinding.py`
- **Algorithm**: Manhattan distance pathfinding (optimal for grid-based movement without obstacles)
- **Data Structures**:
  - `PathStep`: Represents a single coordinate step
  - `PathResult`: Contains path steps, distance, and time estimates
- **Functions**:
  - `calculate_path()`: Calculates optimal path between two points
  - `get_character_position()`: Retrieves current character coordinates from API
  - `parse_destination()`: Parses coordinate strings or named locations
  - `resolve_named_location()`: Resolves named locations to coordinates

### 2. Named Location Resolution
- **Banks**: Finds nearest bank using map API with fallback to known locations
- **Task Masters**: Finds nearest task master using map API with fallback
- **Resources**: Searches map content for resource locations by name
- **Fallback System**: Uses hardcoded known locations when API data unavailable

### 3. Navigation Commands

#### `action goto` Command
- **Usage**: `artifactsmmo action goto CHARACTER DESTINATION [OPTIONS]`
- **Examples**:
  - `action goto mychar 5 10` - Navigate to coordinates (5, 10)
  - `action goto mychar bank` - Navigate to nearest bank
  - `action goto mychar "task master"` - Navigate to nearest task master
  - `action goto mychar copper` - Navigate to nearest copper resource
- **Options**:
  - `--wait-cooldown/--no-wait-cooldown` - Wait for cooldowns between moves (default: wait)
  - `--show-path` - Show path before moving
- **Features**:
  - Automatic pathfinding and execution
  - Progress tracking with Rich progress bars
  - Cooldown handling (wait or fail)
  - Interrupt support (Ctrl+C)
  - Final position verification

#### `action path` Command
- **Usage**: `artifactsmmo action path CHARACTER DESTINATION`
- **Examples**:
  - `action path mychar 5 10` - Show path to coordinates (5, 10)
  - `action path mychar bank` - Show path to nearest bank
- **Features**:
  - Shows step-by-step path without moving
  - Displays total moves, distance, and estimated time
  - Supports all same destination types as goto

### 4. Integration Features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for invalid characters, locations, and API failures
- **Progress Display**: Rich progress bars showing current step and elapsed time
- **Cooldown Management**: Respects game cooldowns with optional waiting
- **Interrupt Handling**: Clean cancellation with Ctrl+C
- **Position Verification**: Confirms successful arrival at destination

## Technical Implementation

### Pathfinding Algorithm
```python
def calculate_path(start_x: int, start_y: int, end_x: int, end_y: int) -> PathResult:
    # Uses Manhattan distance with diagonal movement optimization
    # Moves diagonally when possible, then in remaining direction
    # Returns PathResult with steps, distance, and time estimate
```

### Named Location Resolution
```python
def resolve_named_location(location_name: str, character_x: int, character_y: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    # Handles: "bank", "task master", "taskmaster", "task_master"
    # For resources: searches map API for matching content
    # Falls back to known locations if API fails
```

### Navigation Execution
- Reuses existing `move` command internally
- Handles cooldowns with configurable waiting
- Shows progress with Rich progress bars
- Supports interruption with proper cleanup
- Verifies final position and reports success/failure

## Usage Examples

### Basic Navigation
```bash
# Navigate to specific coordinates
artifactsmmo action goto mychar 10 15

# Show path without moving
artifactsmmo action path mychar 10 15
```

### Named Location Navigation
```bash
# Go to nearest bank
artifactsmmo action goto mychar bank

# Go to nearest task master
artifactsmmo action goto mychar "task master"

# Find copper resource
artifactsmmo action goto mychar copper
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Show path before moving
artifactsmmo action goto mychar bank --show-path

# Don't wait for cooldowns
artifactsmmo action goto mychar 5 5 --no-wait-cooldown
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Pathfinding
- **Algorithm Complexity**: O(max(|dx|, |dy|)) - linear in distance
- **Memory Usage**: O(distance) for storing path steps
- **Execution Time**: ~5 seconds per move (including cooldowns)

### API Calls
- **Character Position**: 1 call per navigation
- **Location Resolution**: 1-10 calls for named locations (with caching)
- **Movement**: 1 call per step in path

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Path Caching**: Cache common routes to reduce API calls
2. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Add support if game introduces obstacles
3. **Multi-Destination**: Support for waypoint-based navigation
4. **Auto-Navigation Scripts**: Predefined navigation sequences
5. **Performance Optimization**: Batch API calls where possible

### Extensibility
- **New Location Types**: Easy to add new named location types
- **Custom Algorithms**: Pluggable pathfinding algorithms
- **Progress Callbacks**: Extensible progress reporting system
