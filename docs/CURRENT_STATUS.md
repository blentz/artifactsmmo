## Historical Context (Previous Sessions)

The user's preference is to continue with the systematic approach. You are operating in an infinite loop. Take as many
iterations as required to fully implement the plan to completion. Nothing less than 100% perfection is acceptable.
Refactor as often as necessary. Pass information to future iterations by keeping this file up-to-date with your ideas
and plans. Document bugs and architectural issues here.

## Requirements:
- All data used for evaluating project success must be sourced from the remote game APIs.
