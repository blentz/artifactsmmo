# Bulk Banking Operations Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented bulk banking operations for the ArtifactsMMO CLI to enable more efficient inventory management.

## New Commands Added

### 1. `bank deposit-all CHARACTER`
Deposits all items from character's inventory to bank with intelligent filtering.

**Options:**
- `--type TYPE` - Filter by item type (resource, consumable, equipment, crafting)
- `--keep-equipment/--no-keep-equipment` - Keep equipment items (default: keep)
- `--keep-consumables/--no-keep-consumables` - Keep consumable items (default: don't keep)
- `--continue-on-error` - Continue on individual item errors

**Features:**
- Automatically categorizes items by type
- Keeps essential items (equipment, currency, utilities) by default
- Shows progress bar during bulk operations
- Handles cooldowns between operations
- Provides detailed summary of successful/failed operations

### 2. `bank withdraw-all CHARACTER ITEM_CODE`
Withdraws all of a specific item from bank to character's inventory.

**Features:**
- Automatically detects quantity available in bank
- Shows item name in addition to code
- Handles cooldowns properly
- Clear error messages for missing items

### 3. `bank exchange CHARACTER`
Smart exchange operation that deposits resources while keeping crafting materials and equipment.

**Options:**
- `--deposit-resources/--no-deposit-resources` - Deposit resource items (default: deposit)
- `--keep-consumables/--no-keep-consumables` - Keep consumable items (default: keep)
- `--continue-on-error` - Continue on individual item errors

**Smart Logic:**
- Always keeps equipment (weapons, armor, etc.)
- Always keeps crafting materials, utilities, and currency
- Deposits resources (ores, wood, fish) by default
- Configurable handling of consumables
- Shows exchange plan before execution

## Technical Implementation

### Core Helper Functions
- `get_character_inventory()` - Fetches character inventory via API
- `get_item_info()` - Retrieves item details including type/subtype
- `categorize_item()` - Categorizes items into logical groups
- `filter_items_by_type()` - Filters inventory by item category
- `should_keep_item()` - Determines if item should be kept based on rules
- `execute_single_deposit()` - Executes individual deposit with error handling
- `execute_single_withdraw()` - Executes individual withdraw with error handling

### Item Categories
```python
ITEM_CATEGORIES = {
    'resource': ['ore', 'wood', 'fish', 'mining', 'woodcutting', 'fishing'],
    'consumable': ['consumable', 'food'],
    'equipment': ['weapon', 'helmet', 'body_armor', 'leg_armor', 'boots', 'shield', 'amulet', 'ring'],
    'crafting': ['crafting_material', 'ingredient'],
    'currency': ['currency'],
    'utility': ['utility', 'tool']
}
```

### Progress Tracking
- Rich progress bars with spinner and task progress
- Real-time status updates during operations
- Cooldown countdown display
- Detailed operation summaries with success/failure tables

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API errors
- Cooldown detection and automatic waiting
- Continue-on-error option for bulk operations
- Comprehensive error reporting in summary tables

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Rich formatted progress bars
- Color-coded success/error messages
- Detailed summary tables showing:
  - Item codes and names
  - Quantities processed
  - Error messages for failed operations
  - Overall success rate

### Smart Defaults
- Equipment is kept by default (prevents accidental deposit of gear)
- Currency and utility items are always kept
- Resources are deposited by default in smart exchange
- Consumables handling is configurable

### Flexibility
- Type-based filtering for targeted operations
- Configurable keep/deposit rules
- Continue-on-error for resilient bulk operations
- Clear feedback on what will be processed before execution

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite with 60 test cases covering:
- All new bulk commands
- Helper function functionality
- Error handling scenarios
- Cooldown management
- Edge cases (empty inventory, missing items, etc.)
- Progress display functions

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests for all helper functions
- Integration tests for bulk commands
- Error scenario testing
- Cooldown handling verification
- Mock-based testing for API interactions

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Deposit all resources, keep equipment and consumables
artifactsmmo bank deposit-all mychar --type resource

# Deposit everything except equipment
artifactsmmo bank deposit-all mychar --no-keep-consumables

# Withdraw all iron ore from bank
artifactsmmo bank withdraw-all mychar iron_ore

# Smart exchange: deposit resources, keep crafting materials
artifactsmmo bank exchange mychar

# Smart exchange without depositing resources
artifactsmmo bank exchange mychar --no-deposit-resources
```

## Benefits
1. **Efficiency**: Bulk operations reduce repetitive commands
2. **Safety**: Smart defaults prevent accidental loss of important items
3. **Flexibility**: Configurable filtering and keep rules
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and cooldown management
5. **Usability**: Clear progress indication and detailed summaries
6. **Maintainability**: Well-tested code with comprehensive test coverage

## Files Modified
- `src/artifactsmmo_cli/commands/bank.py` - Added bulk operations and helper functions
- `tests/test_commands/test_bank.py` - Added comprehensive test coverage
- `docs/PLAN_bulk_banking.md` - Implementation planning document

## Success Criteria Met
✅ All bulk commands work reliably
✅ Proper cooldown handling
✅ Clear progress indication
✅ Comprehensive error reporting
✅ 100% test coverage for new functionality
✅ Smart item categorization and filtering
✅ Rich user interface with progress bars and summaries
