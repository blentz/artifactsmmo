# Behavioral Completeness — Ranked Gap Backlog

Generated from `docs/behavioral_completeness/MATRIX.md` via
`artifactsmmo_cli.audit.leverage` (`GapItem` → `rank_backlog` / `leverage_score`).

`score = journey_impact × live_bottleneck × stall_risk` (each 0–3); `IGNORE` gaps
score 0 by construction. `live_bottleneck` is read from the live bot's recent
traces (`traces.jsonl` / `play-trace-Robby-20260606-194205.jsonl`): the character
is currently dominated by `PursueTask` → `GatherMaterials`/`CraftRelief` for
wooden_shield + copper_boots gear, so the **gather → craft → equip** chain
(resources/crafting/items/tasks/combat) is the binding constraint right now,
while the market/cosmetic/info concepts are not.

**All single-session gaps are closed.** Every remaining open item is either a
multi-session architectural effort (deferred section below) or out-of-scope
(IGNORE). The ranked open backlog is empty.

| Rank | Concept | Gap kind | Score | Next step |

## Deferred — multi-session architectural work

These are genuine but NOT single-session: each needs a model change (and, for
two, code plumbing) before an honest proof is possible. Landing a decision core
without the coupling/plumbing would be a vacuous/inert proof (the rejected-tasks
lesson), so they are tracked here rather than force-closed.

- **tasks — taskTrade↔inventory coupling** (blocks the honest items-task termination
  capstone). The shared Liveness apply model collapses `.taskTrade`: it advances
  `taskProgress` UNCONDITIONALLY without consuming the obtained task item
  (`Plan.lean` ~316-321 "the Lean model does not track per-trade inventory
  deltas... collapse the chain into a single conservative step"). An honest
  end-to-end termination proof requires: (1) `.taskTrade` consumes the task item
  from `inventoryItems`; (2) `.gather`/`.craft` deposit the actual task item;
  (3) re-prove `TaskCompleteReachable`/`RecipeChainClosure`/`SkillGapClosure`
  under the coupled model; (4) the capstone composes obtainment→inventory→trade.
  This is an architectural change to ~100 proven liveness modules — needs its own
  spec→plan cycle, not a single gap-closure. A first vacuous capstone attempt was
  caught by adversarial review (feasibility = "task incomplete", trade decoupled
  from obtainment) and REJECTED; only Task-1's honest keep-set/batch contracts
  were kept.

- **monsters — selection core PROVEN; producibility wiring deferred.** The decision
  (pick the monster minimizing expected kills = rate/avg_qty for a needed drop) is
  now a landed, proven, differentially+mutation-locked GatherSelection-shaped core:
  `src/artifactsmmo_cli/ai/monster_drop_selection.py` ↔ `formal/Formal/MonsterDropSelection.lean`
  (axiom-clean). The DATA fix landed too: `_monster_drops` restores `min_quantity`
  (was dropped at load) so avg_qty is faithful, + a `GameData.monsters_dropping(item)`
  accessor. STILL DEFERRED: monster-drops remain non-producible (`tiers/strategy._producible`
  + `prerequisite_graph` treat them as leaves) and FightAction is only emitted by
  combat-XP goals, NOT by any `ObtainItem(drop_item)` goal — so `select_monster_for_drop`
  has NO live caller and is INERT. Remaining work: a new ObtainItem→FightAction goal/action
  path wired into the arbiter action set with `select_monster_for_drop` as the target
  picker (deep model change). NOT CLOSED until that wiring lands.

- **grandexchange — needs order-book ingestion.** The GE is in-API but `game_data`
  has zero order-book ingestion. The only honest decision is immediate-fill
  liquidation (sell into an existing fillable buy order vs NPC — an `Option`-gated
  dominance proof); a posted-price proof would be a sham (posted price ≠ realized
  proceeds). Needs `/grandexchange/orders` plumbed into `game_data` +
  `GeFillBuyOrderAction` first, then `liquidation_venue` + `LiquidationVenue.lean`.
  Two-session.
