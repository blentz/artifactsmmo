API Client Wrapper

This module provides a wrapper around the generated artifactsmmo-api-client
to integrate with the AI player system. It handles authentication, error handling,
rate limiting, and response processing with Pydantic validation.

The wrapper abstracts the raw API client and provides a clean interface
for the AI player while ensuring proper cooldown management and error recovery.
