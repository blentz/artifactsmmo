Cache Manager

This module manages game data caching using the existing yaml_data.py pattern.
It stores items, monsters, maps, resources, and NPCs using Pydantic models
for validation and maintains cache freshness for optimal performance.

The CacheManager reduces API calls by maintaining local copies of game data
while ensuring data integrity through Pydantic validation.
