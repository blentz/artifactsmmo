Diagnostic Commands Module

This module provides comprehensive diagnostic and troubleshooting commands
for the AI player system. Essential for debugging GOAP planning, state management,
and action execution issues.

The diagnostic commands enable deep introspection into the GOAP planning process,
state validation, action analysis, and system configuration troubleshooting.
