CLI Main Entry Point

This module provides the main command-line interface for the ArtifactsMMO AI Player.
It handles argument parsing, command routing, and integrates with all system components
including character management, AI player control, and diagnostic commands.

The CLI supports character CRUD operations, AI player lifecycle management,
and comprehensive diagnostic tools for troubleshooting GOAP planning and state management.
