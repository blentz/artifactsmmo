"""
Task Management System for ArtifactsMMO AI Player

This module provides task discovery, tracking, and completion management for the AI player.
It integrates with the ArtifactsMMO task system to provide structured progression goals
and optimal task selection based on character capabilities and progression strategy.

The task manager works with the GOAP system to prioritize task-based goals and generate
action plans for efficient task completion and reward optimization.
