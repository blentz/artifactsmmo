Gathering Action Implementation

This module implements the gathering action for collecting resources in the game.
It handles tool requirements, skill level checks, and inventory management
while integrating with the GOAP system for resource collection planning.

The GatheringAction demonstrates proper handling of skill-based actions and
resource collection mechanics within the modular action system.
