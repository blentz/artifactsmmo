Combat Action Implementation

This module implements the combat action for fighting monsters in the game.
It handles monster engagement, HP requirements, and combat result processing
while integrating with the GOAP system through the BaseAction interface.

The CombatAction demonstrates proper handling of combat mechanics and
state management for monster fighting scenarios.
