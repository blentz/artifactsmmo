Movement Action Implementation with Factory Pattern

This module implements the movement action for the GOAP system, serving as the
primary action for character positioning and pathfinding within the game world.

The MovementAction demonstrates proper BaseAction implementation using GameState
enum for type safety and integration with the API client for actual execution.
Includes MovementActionFactory for dynamic generation of movement actions.
