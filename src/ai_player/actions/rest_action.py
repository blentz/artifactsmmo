Rest Action Implementation

This module implements the rest action for HP recovery in the game.
It handles HP threshold checking, safe location validation, and recovery
timing while integrating with the GOAP system for survival planning.

The RestAction demonstrates proper handling of character survival mechanics
and emergency recovery within the modular action system.
