Goal Manager with Cooldown-Aware Planning

This module manages dynamic goal selection and GOAP planning for the AI player.
It integrates with the existing GOAP library to provide intelligent goal prioritization
based on character progression and current game state.

The GoalManager uses the modular action system and GameState enum to generate
action plans that efficiently progress the character toward maximum level achievement.
Includes cooldown awareness to prevent invalid planning when character is on cooldown.
