AI Player Main Orchestrator

This module contains the main AI Player class that orchestrates the entire
autonomous gameplay system. It coordinates state management, GOAP planning,
goal selection, and action execution in a continuous game loop.

The AI Player serves as the central controller that integrates all system
components to provide intelligent, goal-oriented character automation
for the ArtifactsMMO game.
