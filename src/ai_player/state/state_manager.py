State Manager

This module manages game state synchronization between the API and the GOAP system.
It ensures that character state is always current and properly formatted using
the GameState enum for type safety.

The StateManager is responsible for fetching character state from the API,
converting it to the internal GameState format, and maintaining state consistency
throughout the AI player operation.
