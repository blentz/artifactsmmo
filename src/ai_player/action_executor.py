Action Executor

This module handles the execution of GOAP actions via the API client.
It manages cooldown checking, API calls, error handling, and result processing
to ensure reliable action execution within the AI player system.

The ActionExecutor bridges the gap between GOAP planning and actual API execution,
handling all the timing and error recovery required for robust gameplay automation.
