"""
Inventory and Bank Optimization System for ArtifactsMMO AI Player

This module provides intelligent inventory management, bank optimization, and item
organization strategies for the AI player. It integrates with the GOAP system
to ensure efficient resource management and prevent inventory-related bottlenecks.

The inventory optimizer works with economic intelligence and task management
to prioritize items based on current goals and economic value.
