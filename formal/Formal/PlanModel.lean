Plan-action model for the plannability-soundness theorem
(`Formal.PlanModel.min_plan_length_le_plan`).

## What this models

The three action kinds a plan can contain to obtain and optionally equip an
item:

  * `gather code`  — visit a resource tile and collect one copy of `code`.
  * `craft  code`  — consume the recipe inputs for `code` and produce one copy.
  * `equip  code`  — move `code` from inventory to an equipment slot.

A `Plan` is a `List Action`. The model threads a multiset (represented as an
assoc-list `List (String × Int)`, MIRRORING the `(Int × List (String × Int))`
state shape of `_min_gathers` and `_min_crafts`) through `List.foldl` to give
`produces`: the net holdings after executing the plan from an initial `owned`
state, together with a `gathers` count and a `crafts` count.

## Faithfulness: recipe inputs are required and consumed

`applyAction` for `craft code` is intentionally **total** (it always +1 the
holdings unconditionally) so that the mass-conservation induction in Task 5 can
reason over the `foldl` shape without case-splitting on recipe validity at every
step.

Faithfulness is enforced by the **`ValidPlan`** predicate: it tracks the
step-by-step holdings via a `foldl` over `(Bool × ExecState)` and checks, at
every `craft` action, that all recipe inputs are present in the current holdings.
`SatisfiesEquip` REQUIRES `ValidPlan` — a plan that cheats (crafts without
inputs) is not a satisfying plan. The sanity `example` at the bottom confirms
the 2-action cheat plan `[craft "feather_coat", equip "feather_coat"]` is
rejected.

**Validity-modeling choice: option (b).**
Keep `applyAction` total; thread validity as a `Prop` predicate (`ValidPlan`)
and require it in `SatisfiesEquip`. Rationale: option (a) (guarded relation /
`Option`) would require partial-function reasoning throughout Tasks 5–7. Option
(b) keeps the `foldl` shape simple and matches the extracted cores (`_min_gathers`/
`_min_crafts` are also total functions). The induction strategy for Task 5 is:
induct on the plan list, unfold `foldl` one step, case-split on the action kind,
use `ValidPlan` to obtain the recipe-input inequalities, and apply the
mass-conservation hypothesis.

## Provability rationale

State threading via `List.foldl` with an assoc-list matches the extracted cores
exactly:
  * `_min_gathers` (MinGathers.lean) threads `(total, owned)` via `foldl`.
  * `_min_crafts`  (MinCrafts.lean)  threads `(total, owned)` via `foldl`.

This alignment means Tasks 5–6 can proceed by structural induction on `Plan`
unfolding `foldl` one step at a time, and the measure `state.1` (gather/craft
count) and `state.2` (holdings) evolve at each step in a shape the extracted
definitions already reason about.

## NOT modelled (explicit abstraction boundaries)

The following are **outside this model** and are noted here for honesty:

  1. **Movement** — `gather` and `equip` implicitly assume the character is at
     the right tile/bank; travel steps are not counted. The lower bound is still
     sound (travel adds steps, not removes them).
  2. **Inventory space** — the model does not track bag capacity; a real plan
     may need extra deposit/withdraw steps when the bag fills.
  3. **A\* completeness** — the model assumes the planner finds a plan if one
     exists; proving A\* completeness is out of scope.
  4. **Batch crafting / multi-drop** — `craft` produces exactly 1 copy, and
     `gather` yields exactly 1 unit. `ceil_gathers` (via `max_gather_yield`)
     accounts for multi-drop resources at the `minPlanLength` level; the
     per-action model uses 1 for structural clarity.

-- Plan execution state
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-- Execution state threaded through a plan via `List.foldl`.

  * `gathers` — number of `gather` actions executed so far.
  * `crafts`  — number of `craft`  actions executed so far.
  * `holdings` — assoc-list multiset of items accumulated/consumed.

The `(gathers, crafts, holdings)` triple mirrors the `(total, owned)` state of
the extracted cores, extended with a separate `crafts` counter. Keeping both
counters in the state (rather than post-computing from the list) lets the
induction in Tasks 5–6 reason step-by-step without a second pass. -/
structure ExecState where
  gathers  : Nat
  crafts   : Nat
  holdings : List (String × Int)
  deriving Repr

/-- Apply one `Action` to an `ExecState`.

  * `gather code` — increment `gathers`, add 1 to `holdings[code]`.
  * `craft  code` — increment `crafts`, CONSUME all recipe inputs for `code`
                    (decrement `holdings[mat] -= per` for each `(mat, per)`
                    in the recipe), then add 1 to `holdings[code]`.
                    **Faithfulness note**: this function is TOTAL and performs
                    the consumption unconditionally. Pre-condition (inputs
                    present) is enforced by `ValidPlan` / `ValidCraftAt`; the
                    induction in Task 5 uses `ValidPlan` to obtain the ≥-bounds
                    needed to show consumption does not create negative holdings.
  * `equip  code` — no state change (equip is counted at the `Plan` level via
                    `SatisfiesEquip`, not inside the per-action fold). -/

/-- `ValidCraftAt recipes holdings code` holds when all recipe inputs for `code`
are present in `holdings` with at least the required quantity.

This is the per-step pre-condition enforced by `ValidPlan` at each `craft`
action: the craft is only valid when all ingredients are in hand. -/

  | some p => p.2

/-- `ValidGatherAt recipes code` holds when `code` is **raw** — it has no recipe
entry (an empty input list). A resource tile only yields raw materials; a
craftable item can never be gathered. This is the per-step pre-condition
enforced by `ValidPlan` at each `gather` action.

**Faithfulness note.** Without this restriction the model's `gather code` would
mint one unit of *any* code — including a fully-craftable item like
`feather_coat` — for a single gather, contradicting the production
`min_gathers` lower bound (`src/.../ai/min_gathers.py`: "a raw material can only
be obtained by gathering"). Requiring the gathered code to be raw is exactly the
production assumption that makes `min_gathers` a sound lower bound, so adding it
*strengthens* faithfulness; the cheat-plan `example` below is unaffected. -/

    (code : String) : Prop :=
  recipeOf recipes code = []

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ValidPlan: all craft actions have their inputs present at execution time
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-- `ValidPlanFrom recipes s plan` holds when, starting from state `s`,
every `craft` action in `plan` has its recipe inputs present in the current
holdings at the moment it executes.

Defined recursively over the plan list, threading state forward one step at a
time (same shape as `runPlan` / `List.foldl`). This makes the Task-5 induction
match: unfold one `foldl` step, case-split on the action, for `craft` extract
the `ValidCraftAt` hypothesis, then continue on the tail. -/
def ValidPlanFrom (recipes : List (String × List (String × Int)))
    (s : ExecState) : Plan → Prop
  | []      => True
  | a :: rest =>
      (match a with
       | Action.craft code  => ValidCraftAt recipes s.holdings code
       | Action.gather code => ValidGatherAt recipes code
       | _                  => True) ∧
      ValidPlanFrom recipes (applyAction recipes s a) rest

/-- `ValidPlan recipes owned plan`: the plan is input-respecting when run from
initial holdings `owned`. -/
def ValidPlan (recipes : List (String × List (String × Int)))
    (owned : List (String × Int)) (plan : Plan) : Prop :=
  ValidPlanFrom recipes { gathers := 0, crafts := 0, holdings := owned } plan

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SatisfiesEquip
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-- `SatisfiesEquip plan item owned recipes` holds when:
  1. `ValidPlan recipes owned plan` — every craft action's inputs are present
     at execution time (faithfulness: the plan cannot conjure items from nothing).
  2. `Action.equip item ∈ plan` — the plan contains an equip action for `item`.
  3. After running the plan from `owned`, the holdings contain ≥ 1 of `item`.

The `ValidPlan` requirement is the KEY soundness fix: without it, the 2-action
cheat plan `[craft "feather_coat", equip "feather_coat"]` would satisfy
conditions 2 and 3 (craft unconditionally +1s holdings) while skipping the
≥80-step recipe closure. With `ValidPlan`, the cheat plan is REJECTED because
the `craft "feather_coat"` action fires with empty holdings — no feathers, no
ash_plank — so `ValidCraftAt` fails. -/
def SatisfiesEquip (plan : Plan) (item : String) (owned : List (String × Int))

    `ceil_gathers(min_gathers(item, qty, recipes, owned), max_gather_yield)
     + min_crafts(item, qty, recipes, owned)
     + (if equip then 1 else 0)`

This delegates to the extracted cores (`Extracted.MinPlanLength.min_plan_length`)
and is the definition Tasks 5–7 prove a lower bound over. -/

-- Sanity check: the 2-action cheat plan is REJECTED

## Sanity check

The following `example` shows the model rejects the unsound 2-action plan.
Given a recipe table where `feather_coat` requires `feather` (10 units) and
`ash_plank` (6 units), and starting with empty `owned`:

  `[craft "feather_coat", equip "feather_coat"]`

is NOT a valid plan (`¬ SatisfiesEquip`) because `ValidPlan` fails: the
`craft "feather_coat"` step fires with 0 feathers and 0 ash_planks, but the
recipe demands 10 and 6 respectively. The `ValidCraftAt` check fails for
`("feather", 10)`.

If this `example` were replaced by `sorry`, the model would still be unsound.
The `by decide` closes because all components reduce to finite decidable checks.

## Conservation identity infrastructure

The deep step of the plannability-soundness proof is `minGathers_le_gathers`:
`min_gathers item 1 recipes owned ≤ planGathers recipes plan owned` for any
`ValidPlan`. The obstacle (see `.git/sdd/task-5-report.md`) is that the plan
recursion runs left-to-right over `List Action` while `_min_gathers` recurses
over the recipe DAG with GREEDY per-branch owned consumption. The bridge is a
GLOBAL conservation identity expressing the gather count as
`q · w(item) − Δ(consumed mass)`.

We work on the HAND model `Formal.StepDispatch.minGathers` (richer lemma base,
shared `getD`/`setD` encoding) and transfer to the extracted
`Extracted.MinGathers.min_gathers` via `Extracted.Bridges.min_gathers_bridge`
only at the API boundary. `PlanModel.dictGet`/`dictSet` are definitionally
`Formal.ShoppingList.getD`/`setD`.

`foldl` can be reasoned about from a zero base and re-summed. Proved by
induction on the fuel; the `foldl` arm uses the IH on each sibling and a

`fuel`: it is the empty-owned `foldl` over the recipe, each material entered at
quantity `per`. (One-step unfold of `wf`; the per-material quantities are the
recipe `per_unit` values since the parent quantity is `1` and holdings empty.)
