Formal model of the FULL craft-plan driver (`craft_plan_full` in
`src/artifactsmmo_cli/ai/craft_plan_driver_core.py`): iterate the kernel-proved
single-step `nextCraftTarget` (Formal/NextCraftAction.lean) to completion,
applying each emitted action's effect to a simulated (inventory, bank) state,
accumulating the whole ordered remaining plan.

Modelling note — the SIX-source obtain model (`ai/obtain_sources.Source`).
`applyState` applies each kind's effect:
  * gather / buy / drop — add `na.qty` of `na.item` to inventory (BUY's gold and
    DROP's drop-rate variance are deliberate abstractions, per the module
    docstring / `feedback_combat_xp_projection_is_abstract`);
  * withdraw — add to inventory AND debit the bank;
  * craft — add the output AND subtract `per * na.qty` of each recipe input
    (consumption; sound on shared intermediates, not just linear chains);
  * recycle — add the output AND debit the SOURCE item `na.code` by
    `⌈na.qty / yieldPer⌉` (mirrors `RecycleAction.apply`). A plan that forgot
    this debit would DOUBLE-SPEND the recycled source. `yieldPer` is looked up
    from the matching recycle Source (as Python does), not carried on the
    action.

The single-step `nextCraftTarget` only emits `craft` when every input is on hand
(ORDERING, proved in NextCraftAction), so consumption never underflows on a
reachable plan; the RECYCLE emission is capped at the source's live stock
(`stepFor`), so the recycle debit never over-draws either.

ROLES proved:
  * per-step validity — every action in the plan is a genuine `nextCraftTarget`
    output for the state at that point (no fabricated steps)
  * head matches B1 — the plan's first action equals the proven single-step
  * empty ⇔ satisfied — an empty plan is returned iff the target is met
  * completion-correctness — executing a COMPLETE plan (fuel not the limit)
    reaches the target

The theorems are re-proved over the WIDENED six-source model (not restricted
back to three kinds): `applyState` threads `sources` and the recycle debit, and
`craftPlan` / `foldPlan` apply the SAME widened `applyState`, so the completion
result holds for the recycle arm too.
