Formal model of `select_bank_deposits` (and `_keep_codes`, `_recipe_materials`,
`_best_fighting_weapon`) from `src/artifactsmmo_cli/ai/bank_selection.py`.

## The policy

`select_bank_deposits(state, game_data)` computes a KEEP-SET of protected item
codes, then deposits exactly the inventory items with `qty > 0` NOT in the keep
set, sorted by `(-sell_value, code)`.

KEEP-SET (`_keep_codes`):
* `{TASKS_COIN}` always;
* `{task_code}` if the character has an active task;
* every inventory item whose `hp_restore > 0` (HP-restore consumables);
* the BEST fighting weapon over `inventory ∪ equipped` — the max-attack `weapon`
  with NO `skill_effects` (tools excluded), ties broken by code ascending;
* `_recipe_materials({crafting_target} ∪ {items-task code})` — the transitive
  recipe-material closure of the equipment crafting target and the active
  items-task item. Banking a task's OWN inputs starves PursueTask and FREEZES
  task progress (the documented freeze invariant).

`_recipe_materials(roots)` is a DFS over `_crafting_recipes` adding every
material key reached by following recipe-submaterial edges from the roots. It
adds the CHILDREN (materials), recursing — exactly the recipe-child relation of
`RecipeClosure`. We REUSE `Formal.RecipeClosure.Reachable` / `satN` /
`closureItems` to model this least-fixpoint walk. NOTE: the Python `walk` adds a
material when it is a *child* of a visited item — i.e. `Reachable` from the roots
but reached via at least one recipe edge. A root that is never a child of any
reachable item is NOT added unless it is itself a child. So `recipeMaterials` =
`{m | StepReachable r roots m}` where `StepReachable` is "reachable via ≥ 1
recipe-child edge from the roots". We define it inductively and relate it to
`Reachable`.

## Model

Items are `Nat` codes. `recipe : Nat → List (Nat × Nat)` is the
`_crafting_recipes` ingredient map (reused `RecipeClosure.Recipe`). Each inventory
item carries `(code, qty)`. Weapon attributes are abstracted to
`attack : Nat → Int` (sum of element attacks), `isWeapon : Nat → Bool`,
`isTool : Nat → Bool` (has skill_effects), `hpRestore : Nat → Int`. Sell value is
`sellValue : Nat → Int`. We prove `select_bank_deposits` deposits EXACTLY the
qty>0 inventory codes outside the keep set, the freeze invariant
`deposits ∩ keep = ∅`, task-input protection, and keep-closure under the
recipe-material walk (the reused fixpoint).

Lean core only — no mathlib.

/-! ### State abstraction. -/

/-- The inputs `select_bank_deposits` reads, abstracted to integer/Nat data.
* `tasksCoin`    — the `TASKS_COIN` code (always kept);
* `taskCode`     — `some c` if the character has an active task, else `none`;
* `taskIsItems` — whether `task_type = "items"`;
* `craftingTarget` — `some t` if an equipment crafting target is set;
* `inventory`    — `(code, qty)` association list (Python `state.inventory.items()`);
* `equipped`     — equipped item codes (`state.equipment` values, non-None);
* `recipe`       — `_crafting_recipes` ingredient map;
* `attack`       — Σ element attack for a weapon item;
* `isWeapon`     — `stats.type_ = "weapon"`;
* `isTool`       — `stats.skill_effects` nonempty (a gathering tool);
* `hpRestore`    — `stats.hp_restore`;
* `sellValue`    — max NPC buy price (0 if none). -/

`_recipe_materials(roots)` adds a material when it is reached as a recipe CHILD of

The recipe-material walk is computed via the reused `closureItems`; a code is a
material iff it is in the closure of `recipeRoots` AND is itself a recipe child of
something (i.e. `StepReachable`). For the oracle we compute the closure and then
filter to those reached via an edge. The simplest faithful executable form: the
walk's added set is `closureItems r roots fuel` minus any root that is never a
child. We compute the material list directly as the children-union over the
closure. -/

NEVER banked. -/

under taking further recipe children. -/
