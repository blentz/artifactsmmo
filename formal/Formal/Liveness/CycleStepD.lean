/-! # CycleStepD — the defer-faithful, adversarially-re-arming cycle

Brick D2 of `docs/PLAN_residual_closure.md`. Three refinements over
`cycleStepF`, each closing (or worst-casing) a named residual of
`docs/LEVEL_FIFTY_RESIDUALS.md`:

1. **Defer-gated arming** (`perceptionRefreshD`): the combat objective is armed
   below 50 ONLY outside the items-task long-haul defer window
   (`deferGate`). Inside the window the cycle pursues the items task —
   production's actual behaviour in the one branch the F-tower
   over-approximated (residual 3). `itemsTaskDeferActive` is a state-carried
   production observation (opaque-Bool discipline); the gate's other two
   conjuncts (`pursueTaskFires`, `taskProgress < taskTotal`) make it
   self-certifying: they are exactly the facts the pursueTask descent needs.
2. **Mint-driven chore re-arm** (`choreRearm` / `rearmOnMint`, Phase A1): EVERY
   cycle that dispatches a `.fight` re-arms ALL 8 chore latches (worst case of
   loot), and the two MINTING chores re-arm the latches lex-below their own
   descent slot (claim → the 7 non-pending flags; completeTask → everything).
   Reach-50 still holds — each row's strict slot lex-dominates its re-arms.
3. **Dispatch-keyed loot** (`pressureDeltaD`): the inventory fill applies iff
   the cycle actually dispatches a `.fight` — the synthetic
   `.objectiveStep` placeholder (a stale-armed Bool inside the defer window)
   loots nothing, matching its no-op production meaning.

Additive only — `cycleStepF` and every existing theorem are untouched.

/-- The items-task long-haul DEFER window: production's observed defer decision
    AND the facts making the window self-certifying for the descent proof.
    Production (`test_objectivestep_arming_diff.py`): defer ⟺ `bootstrap_gap >
    4 ∧ items-task active` — an active items task means phase ∈

/-- Defer-gated perception: arm the combat objective below the cap ONLY outside
    the defer window. Outside it this is exactly `perceptionRefresh` (grounded
    by the arming differential); inside it the state passes through untouched
    and the ladder falls to the items-task means. -/

    batches a single loot/mint event can create. Provisional constant (like

    slot is always lex-dominated by the minting row's own descent. -/

    chore latches — the formerly disclosed claim→overstock cross-arm, now
