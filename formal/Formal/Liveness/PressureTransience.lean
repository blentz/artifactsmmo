/-! # PressureTransience — Workstream A Phase-1 Brick 3d-c (counting): close
`ReducedResidualF`'s low-pressure conjunct from the local dichotomy.

The local dichotomy is complete (fight side `PressureBurst`, drain side
`PressureDrain`). This module does the bounded-burst COUNTING that turns it into the
`ReducedResidualF` the faithful capstone needs: from the genuine scheduling residual
(`TenQuietPairsBelowCapInfinitelyOften` — the ten non-pressure blockers quiet on two
CONSECUTIVE refreshed selection states, below the cap, infinitely often) plus
`Drainability.RuntimeInvariant` and the capacity non-degeneracy invariant, it proves
`FightFairnessF.ReducedResidualF`.

## Why a quiet PAIR resolves the coincidence

`ReducedResidualF` needs a position that is BOTH low-pressure AND ten-quiet, i.o. A
single ten-quiet position may be high-pressure; the drain then fires but only the
NEXT position is low — which need not be ten-quiet. A quiet PAIR `(k, k+1)` closes
the gap: if pressure is low at `k`, `k` is the witness; if high, `RuntimeInvariant`
arms a drain channel, the drain step (`cycleStepF_drains_when_pressured_armed_tenQuiet`)
empties the bag, so `k+1` is low-pressure — AND ten-quiet by the pair. Either way a
witness exists. The pair residual is still PURELY about the ten non-pressure blockers
(the honest scheduling residual); it asks they be quiet in runs of length two, which
is what genuine transience (a blocker's clear lasts more than an instant) delivers.

This discharges the low-pressure conjunct WITHOUT assuming it — the faithful win.
What remains a residual is exactly: the ten non-pressure blockers quiet i.o. (pairs)
+ drainability when pressured + positive capacity — all honest, checkable
properties, NO inventory-composition fabrication.

## SOUNDNESS BOUNDARY (adversarial review, 2026-06-19)

This argument is LOAD-BEARING on `InventoryDynamics.pressureDelta` modelling every
reducer as `inventoryUsed → 0` (the high-pressure branch does `rw [hdrain]` with
`hdrain : (cycleStepFN (k+1) s).inventoryUsed = 0`, then `omega`). That `→ 0` is
OPTIMISTIC, not conservative: production's `depositFull` plausibly empties the bag,
but `discardHigh`/`sellPressured`/`discardCritical`/`craftRelief` remove only
specific items (a PARTIAL drain). The transience needs each drain to land STRICTLY
BELOW 85%; `→ 0` is the extreme that trivially satisfies it. The honest differential
obligation (NOT yet discharged) is to verify production's reducers drop pressure
below the 85% re-trigger watermark; if some reducer leaves pressure ≥ 85%,
`pressureDelta` must weaken to a realistic partial drain and this counting must be
re-derived (likely needing a pressure-decrease-bounded-below assumption). Until then,
"the faithful cycle reaches 50" holds for the `→ 0`-drain MODEL, with that model's
fidelity to production resting on the pending `pressureDelta` differential test.

Local `perceptionRefresh` bridges (inventoryUsed/Max, hasOverstockItems,
sellableInventoryNonempty) are proved inline — `perceptionRefresh` touches only the
two objective Bools, so each is `split <;> rfl`.

    below the cap with the ten `nonPressureBlockers` quiet. Purely about the ten
    non-pressure blockers (the four pressure-gated chores are handled by the pressure
    dynamics); asking quietness in runs of length two is what genuine blocker
    transience supplies. -/

/-- **Close the low-pressure conjunct.** From the quiet-pair scheduling residual,
    `RuntimeInvariant` (drainability when pressured), and the positive-capacity
    invariant, `ReducedResidualF` holds — the low-pressure conjunct is DISCHARGED, not
    assumed. At a quiet pair: low pressure at `k` ⇒ `k` witnesses; high pressure at
    `k` ⇒ the drain empties the bag so `k+1` is low-pressure and (by the pair)
    ten-quiet, witnessing. -/
