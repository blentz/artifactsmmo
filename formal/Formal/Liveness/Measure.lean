  Formal.Liveness.Measure

  Lexicographic measure function over the planner's projected `State`.

  Phase-19b deliverable #1 (see `docs/PLAN_liveness.md`, Phase 19 / M4).
  Phase-19c extends the measure from a 5-tuple to a **6-tuple** so that
  `GatherAction`'s progress (which only increments a per-skill XP counter)
  can be observed as a measure decrease. The change is forced by Gather's
  semantics: it does NOT advance `task_progress` (the production comment at
  `gathering.py:59` explains why only `TaskTradeAction` increments task
  progress), and it INCREASES `inventory_used` (a drop is added). Therefore
  Gather progresses only via a per-skill XP delta — that signal must live
  in the measure ABOVE `bankPressure`, so Deposit (which drops bank
  pressure independently) can fire when needed without violating the
  decrease invariant.

  Components, ordered most significant first (slot index in parens):

    (1) levelDeficit             : 50 - state.level
    (2) xpDeficit                : xpToNext - state.xp
    (3) taskCycles               : taskTotal - taskProgress
    (4) skillXpDeficitProjected  : targetSkillXp - projectedSkillXpDelta
        (NEW in 19c — decreases on Gather)
    (5) bankPressure             : max(0, inventoryUsed - 4 * inventoryMax / 5)
        (decreases on Deposit; Gather may INCREASE it, dominated by slot 4)
    (6) hpDeficit                : maxHp - hp
        (decreases on Rest; Fight may INCREASE it, dominated by slot 2)

/-! ## Planner-side state model

A minimal `State` mirroring exactly the fields the Phase-19b/c action lemmas
read or write. This is NOT a faithful image of `src/.../world_state.py`'s
`WorldState`; it deliberately omits coordinates, equipment, bank items, and
cooldown — those are irrelevant to the local-progress measure.

Field names use Lean conventions (camelCase). Each maps one-to-one onto a
`WorldState` field (snake_case), documented inline.

Phase 19c adds two scalar fields for the single-skill MVP of
`projected_skill_xp_delta` / the active LevelSkillGoal's target:

  * `projectedSkillXpDelta` — single-skill scalar of
    `WorldState.projected_skill_xp_delta[skill]` for the currently-tracked
    skill. The dict is collapsed to a scalar because the headline lemma
    operates on a single (drop, skill) pair.
  * `targetSkillXp` — the active `LevelSkillGoal`'s target xp for that
    skill. State-carried (NOT a new axiom). When no LevelSkillGoal is
    active, callers pass `0` and the slot is a no-op (deficit is `0 - 0 = 0`).

      goal whose first planned action is `Fight`. Production: the
      `ReachCharLevel` meta-goal (`tiers/meta_goal.py::ReachCharLevel`,
      satisfied when `state.level ≥ target`) and monster-task / combat
      objectives dispatch a plan led by `FightAction`. This is the model's
      ONLY faithful general char-XP-leveling path: `.fight` grants +10 char
      xp + rollover, and OBJECTIVE_STEP sits at ladder idx 14 (before the
      discretionary task means), so unlike a discretionary-tail grind means
      it can actually be SELECTED.

      Defaults to `false` — every legacy fixture/proof keeps the no-op
      `objectiveStep` semantics (`planFor .objectiveStep = [.objectiveStep]`).

      `craft_relief_candidates(state, game_data, …)` returns a non-empty
      list (i.e. some task / target_gear / target_tools item is craftable
      from current inventory + skill). State-carried Bool — the Lean
      model doesn't reproduce the recipe walk; a diff harness must
      assert the production computation matches this field. -/

  /-- OPAQUE: production's REST_FOR_COMBAT guard combat conditions. Mirrors
      `tiers/guards.py::_fires(GuardKind.REST_FOR_COMBAT, …)` clauses (a),

      False, and `predict_win` at max hp is True. The remaining clause (b)
      — `state.hp < state.max_hp` — is NOT folded in here; it is checked
      numerically by `restForCombatFires` against `hp`/`maxHp` so the
      cycle-step progress proof can derive `hp ≠ maxHp` for the `.rest`
      witness. State-carried Bool — the Lean model doesn't reproduce
      `predict_win`; a diff harness must assert the production computation
      matches this field. -/

  /-- Phase 23c-3b: lifecycle phase mirror of
      `WorldState.task_lifecycle_phase` (production:
      `src/artifactsmmo_cli/ai/task_lifecycle.py`). The phase is
      INTENDED to satisfy
        `taskLifecyclePhase = deriveTaskLifecyclePhase taskCode taskProgress taskTotal`
      for every state produced via the canonical constructors;
      `taskPhase_consistent` documents this as a separate hypothesis
      (NOT a Prop field on the structure, per Phase 23b's cascade
      lesson). Callers constructing `State` directly bear the obligation
      to set `taskLifecyclePhase` consistently. -/
  taskLifecyclePhase : TaskLifecyclePhase
  /-- Phase 23d-4: cumulative count of action attempts on the current
      task. Incremented by `applyActionKind` on every progress-attempting
      action (`.fight`, `.taskTrade`) while the pre-state phase is
      `.accepted` or `.inProgress`. Reset to `0` on transitions to
      `.none` (via `.completeTask` and `.taskCancel`). Other action
      kinds preserve the counter (via `{s with ...}`).

      Honest disclosure: production's `low_yield_cancel_fires` reads
      `sample_count` from `LearningStore.farm_items_yield`, which is
      recorded per completed cycle of FarmItems-like behaviour (see
      `src/artifactsmmo_cli/ai/learning/projections.py`). This counter
      is a simpler abstraction — it increments per any progress-
      attempting action while a task is active. A future differential
      harness must assert that production's `sample_count` tracks this
      Lean field within model fidelity. The production constant
      `LOW_YIELD_SAMPLE_THRESHOLD` maps to `lowYieldSampleThreshold`
      in `Formal.Liveness.LIV003Decomposition`.

      The counter is NOT part of the lex `Measure` tuple — keeping it
      out of `Measure`/`ExtMeasure` preserves Phase-19 lemmas
      mechanically (they `{s with ...}` over State, so the new field
      is automatically threaded through). -/
  actionsAttempted : Nat
  /-- Phase 23d-8: counter of completed `.craft` applies. Abstract
      counter for recipe-chain closure proofs. Production's
      `CraftAction.apply` composes inventory updates + skill XP delta +
      task progress; the Lean model abstracts these to a single
      counter advance per `.craft` step. -/
  craftableSlots : Nat
  /-- Perimeter Item 1a: production's `task_decision == PIVOT` reads
      LearningStore observations + skill XP curve confidence to decide
      whether the current task is worth pursuing. The Lean model
      abstracts this to a single Bool: `true` when production would
      decide PURSUE (lifecycle progresses toward `.complete`), `false`
      when production would decide PIVOT (lifecycle exits via cancel).
      Required to prove `accept_cancel_loop_bound` structurally — the
      .accepted → cycleStep transition only proceeds toward .complete
      when this is true; otherwise taskCancelFires would trigger early
      and re-enter the .none → .accepted cycle indefinitely. -/
  taskFeasibleProjected : Bool
  /-- Item 1g-A1: model the API's task-code pool. The server's
      `/v3/my/tasks/new` endpoint draws from a finite pool of distinct
      codes (game_data.task_codes). `taskPool` records that pool's
      contents from the Lean side.

      Defaults to the empty list in legacy fixtures — existing
      proofs that don't reason about pool depletion remain green.
      The discharge of `accept_cancel_loop_bound` (Item 1g-A2) requires
      callers to populate `taskPool` from `GameDataFixture`. -/
  taskPool : List String
  /-- Item 1g-A1: codes the bot has already cancelled. Each
      `.taskCancel` apply pushes the current `taskCode` onto this list
      (subject to extension in Item 1g-A2). Pigeonhole: when
      `taskCodesSeen.length ≥ taskPool.length`, the next `.acceptTask`
      cannot pick a fresh code and either rides to `.complete` or the
      pool refresh applies. -/
  taskCodesSeen : List String
  /-- Item 4a: per-item inventory composition. Mirrors production's
      `WorldState.inventory : dict[str, int]`. List-of-pairs representation
      avoids decidability issues with `String → Nat` function fields.
      `(code, count)` pairs; lookup via `invCount`. Multiple entries for
      same code are summed (canonical form has at most one entry per code,
      but proofs don't require it).

      Defaults to empty in legacy fixtures — existing proofs reasoning over
      scalar `inventoryUsed` remain green. `.gather` (Item 4a) increments
      the gatherTarget entry by 1; `.craft` and `.taskTrade` mutation is
      deferred to later sub-items. -/
  inventoryItems : List (String × Nat)
  /-- Item 4a: the resource code the bot is currently gathering. Mirrors
      production's per-cycle `WorldState.gather_target` (perception layer
      derives this from the current goal). `.gather` reads this to know
      which inventory entry to bump. `none` when no gather is active. -/
  gatherTarget : Option String
  /-- Item 4b: equipment composition. Mirrors production's
      `WorldState.equipment : dict[str, Optional[str]]` (slot → item code).
      List-of-pairs representation; missing slot means nothing equipped.
      `.equip` cons-prepends (slot, code); `.unequip` filters out the
      slot; `.optimizeLoadout` mutates per equipTarget. -/
  equipment : List (String × String)
  /-- Item 4b: pending equip target. Mirrors production's per-cycle
      committed equip-action target — the perception/strategy layer sets
      `(slot, item_code)` before `.equip` fires. `none` when no equip
      is pending; `.equip` is a no-op in that case. -/
  equipTarget : Option (String × String)
  /-- Item 4b: pending unequip slot. `.unequip` reads this to know which
      slot to clear. `none` when no unequip is pending. -/
  unequipTarget : Option String
  /-- Item 4c: character map position. Mirrors `WorldState.x` and
      `WorldState.y` (server returns non-negative grid coords; Nat
      keeps arithmetic clean). `.move` writes `moveTarget`; other
      actions preserve. -/
  posX : Nat
  posY : Nat
  /-- Item 4c: pending move destination. Mirrors the per-cycle target
      tile committed by the path planner (player.py builds a PathPlan
      and the MoveAction reads its head). `.move` reads this to know
      where to teleport (single-step abstraction). `.mapTransition`
      reads the same field for cross-map teleports. `none` = no move
      pending; the apply is a no-op. -/
  moveTarget : Option (Nat × Nat)
  /-- Item 4e/5b: per-skill XP delta map. Mirrors production's
      `state.skill_xp_delta : dict[Skill, int]`. List-of-pairs
      representation; missing skill means 0. `.gather` reads
      `gatherSkill` and bumps the corresponding entry; `.craft`
      reads `craftSkill` similarly. The legacy scalar
      `projectedSkillXpDelta` is retained for backward-compat with
      Phase 19 measure lemmas; the per-skill map is the structural
      successor. -/
  skillXpDelta : List (Skill × Nat)
  /-- Item 4e: skill associated with the current `.gather` action. -/
  gatherSkill : Option Skill
  /-- Item 4e: skill associated with the current `.craft` action. -/
  craftSkill : Option Skill
  /-- Item 8: per-skill level. Mirrors production's

      Distinct from `skillXpDelta` which tracks projected XP since
      the last perception refresh. -/
  skillLevels : List (Skill × Nat)
  /-- Item 8: bank inventory. Mirrors `state.bank_items :
      Optional[dict[str, int]]` flattened — list of (code, qty).
      Empty list means bank known to be empty; combined with
      `bankItemsKnown` distinguishes "unknown" from "known-empty". -/

  /-- Item 8: gold deposited in bank (separate from carried `gold`).
      Production tracks via `/v3/my/bank` endpoint. -/
  bankGold : Nat
  /-- Item 8: pending claimable items (e.g. unredeemed task rewards,

/-! ## Server-curve axiom

`xpToNextLevel L` is the server's xp threshold to advance from level `L` to
`L+1`. The exact curve lives server-side; the openapi `/v3/server/details`
endpoint exposes it. We don't model the curve concretely yet (Phase 24's
GameDataFixture is the place for that). For Phase 19b we only need:

  * `xpToNextLevel L > 0` for every `L < 50` — i.e. there is always a
    positive xp budget remaining before max level. This is structurally
    obvious for any sensible curve (a level transition that requires zero
    xp would mean the level doesn't exist), but it is empirically a
    statement about the server response, not a theorem, so it enters as
    an axiom.

AXIOM-ID: LIV-001 | spec: /v3/server/details (xp_curve) | introduced: 2026-05-30
-/

/-- Server-side xp threshold to advance from level `L` to level `L+1`. -/

/-! ## LIV-002 — CompleteTask planner-side XP grant

  LIV-002 (user-approved 2026-06-03 — value revised from 10 → 0)

  Planner-side projection: `CompleteTaskAction.apply` grants
  `TASK_COMPLETE_XP_ESTIMATE = 0` xp per completion. The server
  endpoint `/action/task/complete` returns a `RewardsSchema` whose
  fields are `items` and `gold` only — there is NO XP field. Character
  XP changes during the per-cycle progress actions (fight/gather),
  not at turn-in. The 2026-06-01 value (10) was an empirical guess
  that has since been falsified by direct observation; this `def` is
  the corrected planner constant.

  OpenAPI citation:
    `artifactsmmo-api-client/artifactsmmo_api_client/models/rewards_schema.py`
    — `RewardsSchema.{items: list[SimpleItemSchema], gold: int}`.
  Production reference:
    `src/artifactsmmo_cli/ai/actions/complete_task.py` —
    `TASK_COMPLETE_XP_ESTIMATE: int = 0`.

  Downstream proofs (`LIV003Decomposition.lifecycle_progress_from_bounds_step`,
  `LifecycleBound3/4`) remain structurally correct: the xp-grant
  disjunct now witnesses `xp = s.xp + 0`, and the rollover branch in
  `Plan.applyActionKind .completeTask` becomes dead under LIV-001
  (`xpToNextLevel L > 0` at `L < 50`, so `s.xp + 0 ≥ xpToNextLevel s.level`
  cannot hold under the invariant `s.xp < xpToNextLevel s.level`). -/
def taskCompleteXpEstimate : Nat := 0

/-! ## Item 4d: gold reward estimates

Production task completion rewards `RewardsSchema = {items, gold}`
(no XP). The actual gold amount per task varies per server's task
schema; the Lean model carries placeholder estimates that mirror the
production observation. Future differential phase can pin these from
`game_data.task_rewards`. -/

/-- Gold credit per `.completeTask`. Production server returns the
    exact amount in `RewardsSchema.gold`; placeholder `1` keeps the
    Lean side monotone (every completion grants ≥ 1 gold). -/
def taskCompleteGoldEstimate : Nat := 1

/-- Gold credit per `.npcSell`. Production sums per-item NPC sell
    prices; placeholder `1` keeps the apply monotone. -/
def npcSellGoldEstimate : Nat := 1

/-- Gold credit per `.taskExchange` reward. Production grants a
    task-master coin item (not gold directly); placeholder `0` keeps
    the conservative non-mutation. -/
def taskExchangeGoldEstimate : Nat := 0

/-! ## Task lifecycle phase consistency

The `taskLifecyclePhase` field on `State` is intended to be derivable
from `taskCode`, `taskProgress`, `taskTotal`. The intent is documented
here as a Prop, NOT enforced as a Prop field on `State` (per Phase 23b's
cascade lesson). Callers using the canonical constructors are responsible
for maintaining the predicate. -/

/-- Consistency predicate. Bundles three production invariants:

    1. `taskLifecyclePhase` matches `deriveTaskLifecyclePhase` over the
       raw task fields. Mirrors `WorldState.__post_init__`'s assertion.

    2. `taskCode ≠ some ""`. Production's `WorldState` normalizes empty
       task codes to `None` (see `world_state.py` post-init); only
       `none` or a non-empty `some _` ever occur in reached states.
       CompleteTaskAction transiently sets `task_code=""` but the
       perception layer normalizes that before the next cycle.

    3. `taskCode.isSome → taskTotal > 0`. Production: a real task always
       has positive total; the API never returns `task_code` set with
       `task_total = 0`. -/
def taskPhaseConsistent (s : State) : Prop :=
  s.taskLifecyclePhase =
    Formal.Liveness.TaskLifecyclePhase.deriveTaskLifecyclePhase

/-! ### Well-foundedness

We reduce `measureLt` to the right-associated lex product over `Nat`, for
which Mathlib's `WellFoundedRelation` instance is automatic. -/

/-- Right-associated six-tuple of `Nat` for the embedding. -/
abbrev LexHex := Nat ×ₗ Nat ×ₗ Nat ×ₗ Nat ×ₗ Nat ×ₗ Nat

/-- Embed a `Measure` into the right-associated lex six-tuple. -/
def toLexHex (m : Measure) : LexHex :=
  toLex (m.levelDeficit,
         toLex (m.xpDeficit,
                toLex (m.taskCycles,
                       toLex (m.skillXpDeficitProjected,
                              toLex (m.bankPressure, m.hpDeficit)))))

/-- `measureLt` implies the embedded `<` on `LexHex`.

    This is enough to inherit well-foundedness via `Subrelation.wf`. We do
    NOT prove the reverse direction (the iff) because it isn't needed and
    the encoding is painful in Mathlib's `Prod.Lex` `ofLex`/`toLex` forms. -/
