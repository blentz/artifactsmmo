import Formal.InventoryRoom
/-
Formal model of the slot-bookkeeping core of
`src/artifactsmmo_cli/ai/actions/gathering.py`
(specifically `GatherAction.is_applicable` and `GatherAction.apply`).

The Python `apply` mints `+1` of `drop_item` into the inventory dict; the
planner-projected `inventory_used` therefore increases by exactly one per
chained `apply`. The planner re-checks `is_applicable` on every popped node
(`src/artifactsmmo_cli/ai/planner.py:122`), so the per-step precondition
`inventory_free >= MIN_FREE_SLOTS` is enforced on every step of a multi-step
gather chain.

`MIN_FREE_SLOTS = 3` in the Python (it is a buffer for the executed action,
which may produce ore + random bonus drops); the planner's projection only
mints `+1`, so the precondition is comfortably tight: with `MIN_FREE_SLOTS >=
1`, `apply` cannot mint past `inventory_max`. We bake the contract as `>= k`
for any `k >= 1` and instantiate `k = 3` for the production constant.

The pure cores live in
`src/artifactsmmo_cli/ai/actions/gather_apply_core.py`; the differential test
exercises `gather_apply_pure` / `gather_is_applicable_pure` against this Lean
model.

Lean core only — no mathlib. Nat arithmetic via `omega`.

namespace Formal.GatherApply

is `inventory_max`. The actual item dictionary is irrelevant to the slot-
bookkeeping safety theorem; the diff test pins the per-key bookkeeping
separately. -/

/-- `inventory_free`. Defined symmetrically to the Python property
`WorldState.inventory_free = inventory_max - inventory_used` (with `Nat`
truncating subtraction; the invariant `used ≤ cap` is the safety claim and
is maintained by `apply` when `is_applicable` held). -/

/-- Slot-aware `GatherAction.is_applicable`, mirroring the extended pure core
`gather_is_applicable_pure(inv, k, drop_item)`. The quantity floor
(`k ≤ cap - used`) is retained; when the drop is known (`hasDrop = true`) the
yielded stack must ALSO fit the per-slot cap via `InventoryRoom.hasRoom` — a
NEW drop code needs a free slot (`newStacks = 1`), growing a held code does not
(`newStacks = 0`). `hasDrop = false` recovers the quantity-only `isApplicable`
(the `drop_item = None` caller path). `qtyFree = cap - used`, `slotsFree =
slotsMax - slotsUsed`, `addedQty = 1` (the planner mints exactly one). -/

exactly one item, leaving `cap` unchanged. The pure core's item-dict bookkeeping
is exercised by the differential test; only the slot count matters here. -/

/-- **Per-step mint safety still holds** under the slot-aware check: a passing
gather (with `k ≥ 1`) cannot mint past the inventory cap. Reduces to the
existing `apply_inventory_safe` via the retained quantity floor. -/

/-- **Per-step slot safety**: a passing gather of a KNOWN drop cannot create a
stack past the slot cap — `newStacks` distinct new stacks always fit the free
slot budget (`newStacks ≤ slotsMax - slotsUsed`). For a NEW drop
(`newStacks = 1`) this witnesses a free slot; for a held drop
(`newStacks = 0`) it is trivially satisfied. -/

per-chain invariant the planner depends on (the planner's per-pop
`is_applicable` re-check at `planner.py:122` enforces the per-step `k ≥
MIN_FREE_SLOTS` precondition, but even under the weaker per-step `k ≥ 1`
precondition the chain stays in-band). -/
